### This is the 2nd Generative AI project 

- Here we take a model (GPT 3.5 Turbo) which has a data cut off in Jan 2022
- We add wikipedia information from the years 2022 - 22025. 
- We do the web scraping with response.get()
- We create embeddings
- We calculate cosin similarity
- Based on that we select k answers closest to the question 
- Then we print the initial answer and the custom answer enhanced by RAG. 
- At the end we let the user input his own question from the keyboard
